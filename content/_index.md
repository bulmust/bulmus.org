description: "My journey began with a passion for physics, culminating in a [Ph.D. in computational astrophysics](https://github.com/bulmust/collNuPy). However, my true calling now lies in DevOps engineering. Right now, as a freelance DevOps engineer at [Borda](https://www.bordatech.com/), I thrive on sculpting robust bare metal Kubernetes monitoring structures, ensuring seamless operations.
